10: do we have to make tests?
11b: is formals mutable? if so we must change other things, do we add tests?





Things we have NOT added tests to: 
10
11b

things to fix:
- use .first and .second instead of slicing (probably means changing to recursion)
- 


def do_lambda_form(expressions, env):
    """Evaluate a lambda form."""
    check_form(expressions, 2)
    formals = expressions.first
    check_formals(formals)
    body = expressions.second
    return LambdaProcedure(formals, body, env)
